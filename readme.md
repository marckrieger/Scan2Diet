# Introduction

Scan2Diet is a mobile application that allows users to track the nutritional values of the food that they consume by scanning their grocery receipts. The application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text from the grocery receipts and then uses the extracted text to search for the nutritional values of the food items in a database.

The app aims to be as simple as possible and to make the process of tracking the users' nutriotional habits as easy and as fast as possible. That's why the primary feature of the app is the ability to scan the grocery receipts and to automatically create a list of the food items that the user has purchased.

Please note that the app is still in development and that it does not yet work as intended. The app is currently only usable for experimenting purposes and is not yet ready for public use.
